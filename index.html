<h1>The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>
<br><b> What is A Web Page?</b>
<p>A webpage is a text document written in a language called <b>HTML</b>. <em>HTML</em> stands for <em>hyper text mark up language</em> which is the main document type of the web.</p>
<br><b>How the Web Works?</b>
<p> The web has four components - the <b> Browser, Internet, HTTP</b> (which is the main protocol of the web)<b>, and Servers</b>. When a user open a web <em>browser</em> and connects to www.udacity.com by sending an <em>HTTP</em> request via <em>internet</em>, the <em>server</em> for www.udacity.com will then retrieves the document for the website and sends it back to the user's browser.

<br><b>Computers are Stupid.</b>
<p>The "stupidity" of computer is very frustrating but once the programmer learn to write the correct "syntax" - meaning how to talk to computer in a languange the it can understand, this "stupidity" also gives programmer great power.</p>
<br><b>HTML Vocabulary</b>
<p>The Basic HTML vocabulary consists of <b>Tags</b>, <b>Elements</b> and <b>Attributes</b>. Most <b>Tags</b> have an opening and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag. An HTML <b>element</b> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. The <b> Attribute</b> is a property of an HTML element. This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444"> video</a> will show you the structure of the HTML <em>tags</em> and <em>elements</em> as well as to make links using <em>attributes</em>.</p>
<br> <b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements create an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. <em>a, span, br, tag</em> and <em>strong</em> are all <b>inline</b> elements while <em>div, p</em> and <em>form</em> are<b> block</b> elements.
